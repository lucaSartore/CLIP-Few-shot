    "# CLIP Weighted Model Mixture - Few shot learning technique\n",
    "This notebook implement a novel strategy for clip few shot adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy involve the creation of multiple \"models\" where the output is then weighted\n",
    "to then create an \"average guess\" that should be, on generally more accurate than any individual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far this is a pretty common technique, however there are two key differences that make this approach novel:\n",
    "1. Each model is not a learned model, but is essentially just a prompt. That is then passed through the clip text encoder.\n",
    "The prompts are NOT learned, instead they are manually crafted base on domain knowledge.\n",
    "2. The \"averaging\" is not a simple average, but is a weighted average, and the weights are provided by a \"Re-Weighting Model\"\n",
    "This model is a simple neural network that take as input the clip image embeddings."

    " - **Input**: A one dimensional tensor (or two if considering batch size) that is\n",
    " the visual embedding of the image (i.e. the output of the visual encoder)\n",

    " shaped `number of prompts` x `number of classes`\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will then be used to re-weight the various prompts so to obtain a single score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in a more mathematical way, if we define the following notation:\n",
    " - $T_{ij}$: The text embedding of the class `j` generated with the prompt template `i`\n",
    " - $V$: The visual embedding of the image we are trying to classify\n",

    "At this point a question may emerge:\n",
    "> If your model need to output a set of weights for each class, how will you be able to generalize to novel classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "And the answer is quite straightforward: We add to the output of the model a set of weights that represent the \"novel class\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The way they are trained is quite interesting, but we will discuss it, when it become relevant, for now you just need to\n",
    "note that we have create a custom \"indexing\" layer at the end, that map the original model output from a dimension of `num_base_classes + 1`\n",
    "to a dimension that depends on the number of classes we are trying to classify at a certain point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we can se that a model has being trained on 4 base classes (A,B,C and D) and than\n",
    "it is adapted to be used in a context where 3 of the base classes are still relevant (A,B and D),\n",
    "one is discarded (C) and 3 novel classes are added.\n",

    "This is the reason why the method `update_indexing_mask` is needed. It essentially re-configure the indexing layer to adapt the re-weighter's output to a context where the number of classes has changed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The internal architecture\n",
    "Internally it is a simple network that take as input the visual embedding; it begins by project it into a smaller dimensional space,\n",
    "and then calculating the weights for each prompt and base class.\n",
    "Novel classes instead have a separate vector of parameter that does NOT depends on the input embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially there was not this distinction, and the novel class weights also depended on the image embedding.\n",
    "but we noted that making them independent from the image embedding gave better result (more details on this will follow in the last section of this notebook).\n",

    "### Classification of novel and base category together\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one detail of our project that we haven't addressed yet, but we think this is really important.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could look like from the outside, that our model are actually 2 different models, one for base classes\n",
    "and one for novel classes. And to be fair, this is a reasonable doubt; After all the novel classes\n",
    "has both different prompts and different weights w.r.t. the base one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously creating two separate models would be a bit cheating, after all, most\n",
    "state of the art method have novel classes accuracies that are worst than zero-shot clip\n",
    "So if they where allowed to have two different models, one for novel, and one for base classes\n",
    "they could just use zero-shot clip for novel classes and gain a few percentages in the harmonic mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question now becomes:\n",
    "> What make our approach \"A single model\" instead of two separate one?\n",
    "\n",
    "We think the answer lies in the ability of the model to maintain a good\n",
    "accuracy even when base and novel classes are mixed together.\n",
    "Most paper on clip few shot adaptation only show the accuracy on base classes,\n",
    "the accuracy on novel classes, and then they compute the harmonic mean. And to be fair\n",
    "this is enough for most architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in our case we think that we must also proof that our model can maintain a good\n",
    "level of accuracy even when novel and base classes are mixed, so that we can show\n",
    "that our model is indeed a single one (and not just two specialized models glued together)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that when evaluating with a mixed dataset we lose about 3-4% of accuracy with respect\n",
    "to the harmonic mean. A small drop in accuracy is to be expected, simply because there are more classes\n",
    "and therefore more entropy. This 3-4% drop is in line with the drop that zero-shot clip loses under the\n",
    "same circumstances. So with this, we can confidently say that our model is indeed a single model,\n",
    "and not just two models stitched together\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How did we get here.\n",
    "The doubt about our model being indeed two separate model was totally legit.\n",
    "Indeed one of our first version of the model did act like two separate one.\n",
    "This early prototype had a good harmonic mean, however when \n",
    "testing it with a mixed dataset the accuracy dropped significantly to 65%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular we noted that the model was biased towards base classes,\n",
    "and then in a mixed context the number of pictures of a novel class that\n",
    "where classified as a base class was high, while the number of picture of \n",
    "a base class classified as a novel class where low.\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes we had to make to the program to fix this issue where 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precise masking of text features during training**\n",
    "\n",
    "    We mentioned earlier that during training, if we are handling an example of a virtual-novel class A, based on the base class B\n",
    "    we have to mask the prompts relative to B to keep the training stable.\n",
    "    In an early version we simply masked all prompt relative to base classes, when we where training on virtual-novel classes, and\n",
    "    do vice versa when the opposite scenario showed up.\n",
    "    This however had a problem: there where non examples where base and virtual-novel classes show up together, without any mask,\n",
    "    and the model did not learned properly how to behave when those where mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not using class-specific prompts for novel-classes, and use padding instead**\n",
    "\n",
    "    At first glance, the decision of remove class-specific prompts from novel categories may have sounded a bit weird,\n",
    "    after all, why can't the model learn to ignore them if they are not relevant? Especially considering that it already\n",
    "    does so in the case of base-classes.\n",
    "    We don't have a 100% conclusive answer on this, however we hypnotize that the weighter is still giving\n",
    "    some weight to class specific prompts (that are some times useful, due to the fact that the novel classes\n",
    "    used during training are not actually novel, and just virtually novel).\n",
    "    And so, since the weighter was expecting class specific prompts to be relevant, but then those class specific\n",
    "    prompts where no longer relevant once we switched to real novel classes, the total score for novel classes ended\n",
    "    up being a bit lower then expected. and therefore base classes where chosen more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using learnable parameters for the novel-class weights, instead of basing them on the image embedding**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In an earlier version of our model the re-weighter treated novel and base classes in the same wey.\n",
    "    however we realized that if novel classes's weight where simply learned in place (instead of depending\n",
    "    on the image embedding) the results where better.\n",
    "    This makes sense, as we can expect the embedding of novel classes to be different form the one of\n",
    "    virtual-novel classes, and therefore by cutting that connection we managed to maintain a better accuracy\n",
    "    in the transition from virtual-novel to novel classes."
