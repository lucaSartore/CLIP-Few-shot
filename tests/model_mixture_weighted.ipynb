    "# CLIP Weighted Model Mixture - Few shot learning technique\n",
    "This notebook implement a novel strategy for clip few shot adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy involve the creation of multiple \"models\" where the output is then weighted\n",
    "to then create an \"average guess\" that should be, on average more accurate than any individual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far this is a pretty common technique, however there are two key differences that make this approach novel:\n",
    "1. Each model is not a learned model, but is essentially just a prompt. That is then passed through the clip text encoder.\n",
    "The prompts are NOT learned, instead they are manually crafted base on domain knowledge.\n",
    "2. The \"averaging\" is not a simple average, but is a weighted average, and the weights are provided by a \"Re-Weighting Model\"\n",
    "This model is a simple neural network that take as input the clip image embeddings."

    "It is a small FFNN that has the following Input/Outputs\n",
    " - **Input**: A one dimensional tensor (or two if considering batch size) that is\n",
    " the visual embedding of the image (i.e. the output of the visual encoder)\n",

    " - $V$: The visual embedding of the image we are trying to classify\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example we can se that a model has being trained on 4 base classes (A,B,C and D) and than\n",

    "We mentioned in the previous section that the re-weighter has an output dedicated to \"novel classes\", but\n",
    "how can we train it if we don't have access to the novel classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is to use \"Virtual novel classes\" were we essentially duplicate all of the base classes and create a \"novel\" version of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So essentially, if (like in our case) the classes are 102, and classes with IDs 0 to 50 are base, and IDs 51 to 101 are novel\n",
    "we create 51 new classes, and assign them IDs 102 to 152. Those new classes will have the same images, and same class names\n",
    "as the base one, but will have a different ID, and they will be marked as \"novel\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that all of the virtual novel classes will share a single re-weighter output (it will still be a tensor, because\n",
    "there is one weight for each prompt, but it will not discriminate between the ID 102 and 103 for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so we essentially force the re-weighter to learn a set of weight that can be used to \n",
    "discriminate all the virtual novel classes AT THE SAME TIME, and the assumption we made here is\n",
    "that if a SINGLE set of weights is good at discriminating 51 different classes, the same set\n",
    "will also be good at discriminating 51 new un-seen classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think this assumption is reasonable if we also assume that the split of novel and base classes is not particularly biased."

    "This is the section where we train the re-weighter. Overall, the training is pretty standard, with only two key differences:\n",
    "1. **The masking of some input prompts:** The \"virtual novel\" training samples, create an issue, assume we pass a picture of\n",
    "a rose, through the model twice, the first time we pass it with the label \"rose\" and the second with the label \"rose-novel\".\n",
    "Obviously the model can't predict both of them at the same time, and it will have to pick one, this results in the model being\n",
    "wrong 50% of the times, and thus creating some instability during training.\n",
    "To fix this issue we simply disabled one of the prompts during training, so for example, if I am evaluating \"rose-novel\" I disable\n",
    "all the prompts associated with \"rose\" by setting the text embeddings to zero.\n",
    "The exact implementation details can be seen in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Virtually larger batch size** We had to implement some logic (namely waiting a few batches before calling `zero_grad` and `step`)\n",
    "to simulate larger batch sizes. We found that the re-weighter is extremely hard to train, if we have small batch sizes, on the other hand\n",
    "we also found that the training is really memory intensive sometimes, therefore we we use the aforementioned technique to\n",
    "achieve the same result as large batch sizes, without the same memory requirements.\n"
